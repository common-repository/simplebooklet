On Simplebooklet, you can upload your file and turn it into an impressive page flipping web booklet. Add interactive links and content to your pages, then configure your flipbook experience. You can customize the page turn buttons, the page transition, and all the supporting navigation elements to make sure your content drives engagement.

Make as many booklets as you need and add them to your wordpress site as many times as you want. 

Even better, simplebooklets include hosting, so you won't be impacting your wordpress site at all. 

Simplebooklet can go beyond your wordpress website. You can send them in email, post them to social networks, and share them all from a custom branded unique microsite.  

== Installation ==

First, create your simplebooklet at [https://simplebooklet.com/](https://simplebooklet.com/). Once you have made your simplebooklet, add it to your wordpress website or blog using the following steps.

1. Search for and then activate the Simplebooklet plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress (you only need to do this once).
2. In Simplebooklet, open the PUBLISH tab for the Simplebooklet you want to embed.
3. Tap the Wordpress button in the EMBED ON WEBSITE menu.
4. Copy the Wordpress Shortcode.
5. Paste the Wordpress Shortcode anywhere in your Wordpress Post.

Once you've installed the plugin, you only need to follow steps 2 thru 5 to add more booklets. You can add as many Simplebooklets as you want.

The shortcode looks like this: `[simplebooklet src="{booklet embed url}" width="{booklet width}" height="{booklet height}"]`

The width and height are the native size of the simplebooklet. The width will scale to fit the display area but the height will stay fixed to the native height. You may be too high for your display area. You can change the height to better fit your page display area by adjusting the height in the shortcode. It may take a few times to figure out the right height that works for your page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= There is too much space above and below my simplebooklet =

You can manually adjust the space above and below the booklet by adjusting the height='value' in the simplebooklet shortcode. You may need to do this a few times to get it to display with the right amount of space. A value of 100% will not work.

= How many simplebooklets can I add to my site? =

You can add as many as you want. Add the plugin once and then you can use the shortcode for any of your simplebooklets as often as you want.

= Can I hide the grey vertical menu in the bottom right corner? =

Yes, you can choose which navigation buttons appear on your simplebooklet. Open your booklet in the PUBLISH Tab and select EMBED ON WEBSITES > EMBED CODE > then toggle on or off the features you want on your simplebooklet.
